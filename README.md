# microbit-ble-bridge
A BLE to USB Serial bridge for the micro:bit, using a micro:bit

Use a micro:bit as a Bluetooth Smart Bridge between a(nother) micro:bit
and USB Serial: In order to use a micro:bit as an IoT device it is
necessary to connect it to the wider internet.  Other projects are
underway to use smartphones as the BLE termination point, but this
project aims to enable a second micro:bit to run as a BLE to USB serial
bridge in order to get events and data to and from a host PC.
